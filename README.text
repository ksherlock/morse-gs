Well, this was supposed to be a KansasFest 2020 HackFest entry but I missed
the deadline because I was busy making a pretty video of it in action. Not the
first, and probably not the last time that has happened.

A Desktop IIgs program to play morse code in better-than CD (44.4KHz) audio.

Most IIgs emulators have awful Ensoniq emulation.  GS+ drops samples and 
sweet 16 is over eager to play samples (ie, it doesn't stop when it ought to).
